  Sugarizing the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
 ===============================================

Build platform: Sugar 0.82.1 + Fedora 9


1) Download the JRE

$ BASEDIR="$HOME/Activities/JRE.activity"
$ mkdir $BASEDIR
$ cd $BASEDIR
$ wget \
  --no-check-certificate \
  --output-document='jre-linux.bin' \
  http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=37391

If the link is not correct anymore, go to the Java download page:
  http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
and dowload the "Linux (self-extracting file)" link.


2) Unpack the JRE

$ chmod 755 jre-linux.bin
$ sh jre-linux.bin

Read the license and accept it to continue (scroll as in the "more" command).
The JRE will be unpacked into a directory with the name of the JRE version.
In the example, the directory name is "jre1.6.0_18"

After checking that the unpacking process is complete, erase the package:
$ /bin/rm jre-linux.bin

Rename the JRE folder:
$ mv jre1.6.0_18 jre


3) Add Python code to show something when the activity is run

File "activity.py" has some code to show information to the user.
The "images" folder contains images shown by the Python code.


4) Internationalization (i18n)

Reference for this section:
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Python_i18n


cd $HOME/Activities/Java.activity
# Create the local directories
mkdir -p locale/es/LC_MESSAGES
# Create the "po/Java.pot" file:
./setup.py genpot
# Complete the first lines of the "po/Java.pot" file with the version
# information, your e-mail, etc.
# Initialize a translation file for a given language (e.g. Spanish):
cd po
msginit -o es.po -l es
# The former command creates file "es.po", which should contain the Spanish
# translation. You may see some errors about a "team-address" file not found,
# but the translation file is created anyway.

Modify the "es.po" file to add the Spanish translations.
The command that builds the Sugar bundle will also create a "locale" folder
in the bundle folder containing the binary maps of the translations.


5) The sugarization process required to add the following components:

* "activity" folder (info, icon)
* "setup.py" script (to build the Sugar bundle)


6) Create the Sugar bundle

$ ./setup.py dist_xo
